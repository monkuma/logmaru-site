  <h1 class="page-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. Basic Policy</h2>
    <p>
      LogMaru respects user privacy and is committed to handling information in
      a transparent and minimal manner.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Information Collected</h2>
    <p>
      The desktop application does not collect personal information, does not
      require user registration, and does not transmit user data to external
      servers. Activity logs created in the app are stored locally on the
      user's device. The official website may collect standard access logs
      through the hosting provider for operational purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Purpose of Use</h2>
    <p>
      LogMaru does not use personal data for marketing, profiling, or
      behavioral analysis. Any website access logs are used only for security,
      maintenance, and service stability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. Management of Information</h2>
    <p>
      Because user data is stored locally, users are responsible for managing
      device security and backups. LogMaru does not operate a centralized user
      database.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Third-Party Provision</h2>
    <p>
      LogMaru does not provide personal data to third parties. Links to
      third-party services such as GitHub are subject to those services' own
      privacy policies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Disclosure / Correction / Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      LogMaru does not collect or store personal data in a central database.
      Therefore, there is no server-side personal record to disclose, correct,
      or delete.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>7. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may be revised as needed. Updated versions become effective
      when published on this page.
    </p>
